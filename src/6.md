## Lesson 6

### 1 

The Rule of de Wahl regularises a great number of derivaties. There are six common verbs outside the rule which have special perfect stems.

| Verb | Definition | Perfect Stem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ceder | to yield | cess- |
| mover | to move | mot- |
| venir | to come | vent- |
| seder | to sit | sess- |
| tener | to hold | tent- |
| verter | to turn | vers- |

Compound verbs agree :

> conceder, concession. prevenir, prevention.

### 2 

From nouns and adjectives we form verbs with the following suffixes :

| Suffix | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -ijar | to become | old, oldijar (to grow old) |
| -isar | to become | central, centralisar |
| -ificar | to make | pace (peace), pacificar (to pacify) |
| -ear | movement, repetition | flamme (flame), flammear (to be in flames) |

### 3

We sometimes resort to direct derivation by simply adding `-ar`. There are five cases where we do this.

a) to indicate "provide with" :

> arme (arm, military) ; armar (to arm)

b) with instruments :

> scruve (screw) ; scruvar (to screw)

c) bodily function :

> lácrime (tear) ; lacrimar (to weep)

d) with persons in executive positions :

> judico (judge) ; judicar (to judge)

e) with adjectives, "to make" :

> sicc (dry) ; siccar (to dry)

### 4

Adjectives are formed from nouns by the use of the affixes `-al`, `-ari`, `-ic`, and `-in`. These have a very similar meaning ; `-ari` is frequently used instead of `-al` when an `-l` occurs in the root. Examples :

> nation, national ; regul, regulari ; nase, nasal ; manu (hand), manual ; ornament, ornamental.

### 5

The suffix `-in` is used in a general way as in "mare" (sea), "marin" or to indicate "made of", "aure" (gold), "aurin". Example :

> un aurin anelle, a gold ring.

### 6

The suffix `-ic` is added to many words of Greek origin, but those which end in `-ma` add `-tic`.

> angel, angelic ; barbare (barbarian), barbaric ; problema, problematic.

### 7

There are some other adjectival endings with special meanings :

| Suffix | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -osi | rich in | pore, porosi |
| -at | provided with | barbe (beard), barbat (beared) |
| -atri | similar | spongie, spongiatri (sponge-like) |
| -esc | in the manner of | roman, romanesc |
| -an | belonging to | America, american |
| -esi | geographical | Anglia (England), anglesi (English) |
| -aci | inclined to (added to verbs) | creder (to believe), credaci (credulous) |

Note that `-an` and `-esi` can be used as nouns in the forms `-ane`, `-ese`, e.g., "francese" (French person), "francesa" (Frenchwoman), etc.

### 8

The final `-e` must be retained if it is required to preserve the soft sound of `c` and `g`, e.g., "change", "changear".
