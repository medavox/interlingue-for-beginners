## Lesson 4

### 1

The infinitive ends in `-r`.


| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| amar | to love |
| decider | to decide |
| finir | to finish |

If we cut off the `-r` we are left with the present stem. You will notice that this ends in one of three vowels.

### 2

This present stem is used for the present tense and applies to all person and both numbers.

> Yo ama, tu ama, il ama, etc. (I love, etc.)

### 3

The past tense is formed by adding `-t` to the present stem.

> Yo decidet. ella lavat. noi finit.

### 4 

The future is formed by the auxiliary "va" and the conditional by "vell".

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Ili va ataccar | They will attack |
| Ella va dar me li libre | She will give me the book |
| Il vell venir si il ne vell esser malad | He would come if he were not sick |

### 5

The past participle is the same as the past tense, e.g., "amat", "decidet", "finit". The present participle is formed by adding `-nt` to the present stem. In the case of verbs whose root ends in `-i` however `ent` is added, e.g., "amant", "decident", "finient".

### 6

The verb "to have" is "haver" but as an auxiliary this is shortened to "har" :

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Vu havet un cane. | You had a dog. |
| Yo ha scrit un articul pri apes. | I have written an article about bees. |
| Ella hat vestit se ante que su amica venit. | She had dressed herself before her friend came. |
| Noi vell har protestat contra li prohibition. | We would have protested against the prohibition. |

### 7

The passive is formed in the same way as in English.

Note however that the present tense of "esser" is "es".

> It es productet de carbon. (It is produced from coal.)

### 8

Other auxiliaries are shown below. Note that "mey" is invariable.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Ella mey venir | She may come. |
| Tu volet parlar con me. | You wished to speak to me. |
| Noi deve insister. | We must insist. |
| Vu posse partiprender. | You can take part. |

### 9

The present stem is used as the imperative. A politer form consists of the word "ples" plus the infinitive.

> Veni (or) Ples venir.    (Come)

### 10

The participles can be used as adjectives, or by adding `-e`, `-a` or `-o` as nouns.

| Ie | En |
| --- | --- |
| Li amat filio | The beloved son |
| Li amant matre | The loving mother |
| Li amanto vole besar su amata | The lover wishes to kiss his beloved |

### 11
